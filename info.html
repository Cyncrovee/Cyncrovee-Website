        I use a bunch of different programs and tools for my projects, including
        but not limited to...
      </h2>
      <h3>Editors:</h3>
      <h4>Emacs</h4>
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs on the GNU Website</a>
      <p>
        The classic, extremely extensible display editor. Emacs can help you do
        everything from working on progrmming projects, browsing the web, using
        email, chatting over Matrix, and more!
      </p>
      <p>
        While Emacs has it's own editing model OOTB, I personally prefer evil
        mode- a Vi layer that provides support for Vim-esque modal editing.
      </p>
      <h4>JetBrains Rider</h4>
      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/"
        >Rider on the JetBrains Website</a
      >
      <p>
        One of the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEs, Rider is primarily used and built
        for DOTNET development, and can be used cross platform (Windows, Linux &
        MacOS) which makes it especially useful for me, as I dual boot and my
        laptop uses only Linux. There is also a plugin to provide better support
        for developing AvaloniaUI applications, which is immensely useful.
      </p>
      <h4>Visual Studio</h4>
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/"
        >Visual Studio on the Microsoft Website</a
      >
      <p>
        Visual Studio is a IDE primarily used for DOTNET development, like
        Rider. While it unfortunately only supports Windows, it is a very well
        made IDE with lots of support behind it.
      </p>
      <h4>VS Code</h4>
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code Website</a>
      <p>
        VS Code is a (relatively) lightweight code editor and has many,
        <i>many</i> use cases. It supports quite a few languages out of the box,
        and there are many extensions to support more languages, or improve said
        support. The extension ecosystem is a big draw to VS Code, and one of
        the main reason I use it. I use VS Code primarily for light code
        editing, and as a bit of a swiss army knife for developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, I develop this website mostly using VS Code!
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server"
          >This extension</a
        >
        provides a live preview of HTML files, which proves very useful!
      </p>
      <h4>Neovim</h4>
      <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim Website</a>
      <p>
        Neovim is a fork of the modal terminal text editor Vim, focused on
        extensibility. Vim is known for it's complex but useful keybonds,
        allowing for fast and efficient text and code editing. Neovim takes it
        one step further by embedding Lua as it's scripting language, allowing
        much easier creation of plugins to extend the functionality of Neovim.
      </p>
      <h4>Godot</h4>
      <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Website</a>
      <p>
        Godot is a free and open course game engine. It's been in development
        for many years, and has become a reliable choice for game development
        (and can even be used for GUI development!)
      </p>
      <h3>Terminals:</h3>
      <h4>Ghostty</h4>
      <a href="https://ghostty.org">Ghostty Website</a>
      <p>
        A new, modern terminal emulator that a lot of people have been switching
        to. I use it for it's nice OOTB experience, as it has a kind of "config
        free" approach (though still does support customisation and
        configuration).
      </p>
      <h4>Windows Terminal</h4>
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal"
        >Windows Terminal GitHub Repository</a
      >
      <p>
        Windows Terminal is a terminal emulator for Windows that's a bit more
        advanced than the built in Windows terminal emulators, and I primarily
        use it because it has a more modern design, and a lot of
        customizability.
      </p>
      <h3>Other:</h3>
      <h4>Markdown</h4>
      <p>
        Markdown (.md) is a markup language that is widely used for many apps
        and services. Chances are, you might have used a markdown based editor
        before, and might not have even realised it! Discord, Reddit and Tumblr
        all have markdown options when editing. README files are also often
        written with Markdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markdown excels at taking notes, which makes it a great choice for
        managing projects.
      </p>
      <h4>Org Mode</h4>
      <a href="https://orgmode.org">Org Mode Website</a>
      <p>
        Org Mode is a fantastic organisation tool, and one of the best parts of
        the aforementioned Emacs. It is similar to Markdown, however has a lot
        more tooling and functionality in my opinion.
