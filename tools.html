			<h1>The Editors, Programs, and General Tools That I Use</h1>
			<h2>Emacs</h2>
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs on the GNU Website</a>
			<p>The classic, hyper-extensible display editor- Emacs has been around for 40~ years and is still going
				strong.
				Emacs is more than just a text editor (although I do love my text editors),
				it's a web browser, an email client, a music player, a lisp engine, and it can run both as a GUI
				app, and in
				the terminal!
				Emacs is a tad difficult to get into compared to other editors, but the reward for understanding and
				configuraing it is more than worth it in my opinion.</p>
			<h2>Fish</h2>
			<a href="https://fishshell.com">The Fish Shell Website</a>
			<p>The friendly interactive shell, AKA Fish, is a fantastic command line shell that has great features
				out of
				the box with little to no setup required-
				syntax highlighting, intelligent autosuggestions, and Vi bindings! I would highly recommend it to
				someone
				who's unfamiliar with the command line,
				and even if you're a very experienced with the CLI it's still a great option for a shell. It
				recently had a
				rewrite in Rust!</p>
			<h2>Ptyxis</h2>
			<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis/">The Ptyxis Repository</a>
			<p>Speaking of the command line, the terminal I prefer is Ptyxis, a slick, modern terminal perfect for
				GNOME
				users (like myself :])
				It has a lot of configurability, a lot of built-in themes, and you configure it primarily through
				the GUI,
				which some may prefer.
				The terminal has a big focus on supporting containers and container management programs like Podman
				and
				Docker,
				though I don't have too much experience with this myself.</p>
